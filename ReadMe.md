## Implementation of ADAS algorithms on F1/10th using Arduino IDE.

**Objective:**

The objective was to design and implement the vehicle control algorithms such that vehicle was able to maintain a distance of 30cm from any object placed ahead of it. It was also required to stop the vehicle 30cm away from a stationary obstacle placed ahead of it. The second was to maintain a distance of 40cm from the side wall and remain in the center of the defined lane.

**This task was divided into the following activities:**
 - Adaptive Cruise Control
  - Sampling the time data received from the sensor
  - Implementing Exponential Filter
  - PID Implementation
  - PWM Implementation
 - Autonomous Lane Keeping
  - Sampling the time data received from the sensor
  - Implementing Exponential Filter
  - PID Implementation
